# BIOS2 Biodiversity Modelling 2025 Summer School collaboration repository

This repository provides resources and scripts for the Biodiversity Modelling 2025 summer school, with a focus on using the Madingley model. üåç

The purpose is to facilitate collaboration and learning among students: run simulations, analyse results, and share reusable code. This is a living project ‚Äî contributions are welcome! ü§ù

You are encouraged to contribute by:
- üß© Adding reusable functions to the `R/` folder.
- üì¶ Packaging the project as an R package for better organization and sharing.
- üéõÔ∏è Creating a Shiny app in the `app/` folder to visualise simulation outputs.
- üìù Writing vignettes in the `vignettes/` folder to document workflows and collaboration guidelines.
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Creating simulation scripts using the `MadingleyR` package in the `scripts/` folder.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the repository

To get started, make sure you have Git installed and configured and then clone the repository

```bash
# Configure your Git username and email if you haven't already
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your.name@institution.com

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bios2/biodiversity_modelling_2025.git
```

### Working with the repository

You can work with the repository in your preferred R environment, such as RStudio, JupyterLab or vscode, or directly in R :

```bash
cd biodiversity_modelling_2025
R
```

### Installation Instructions for local machine

Follow the instructions in the `vignettes/installing_madingleyR.md` file to install the `madingleyR` package and its dependencies on your local machine. This is essential for running biodiversity simulations using the Madingley model in R.

```r
# Install the packages for package development
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "usethis"))

# Install shiny package if you haven't already
install.packages("shiny")
```

### Run the demo simulation

```r
# Load the package
library(MadingleyR)

source("scripts/demo_madingley.R")
# or run the demo script directly
# Rscript scripts/demo_madingley.R
```

## Modifying the Madingley R code
You need to reinstall the package containing the source code.
Prerequisites: pull the latest version of the repository to ensure you have the most recent changes. Or a specific branch you want to work on.
First uninstall your current version of the package:

```r 
  try(detach("package:MadingleyR", unload = TRUE))
  try(remove.packages("MadingleyR"))
```

Then reinstall the package from the local source code:

```r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github(
  "bios2/biodiversity_modelling_2025",
  subdir = "MadingleyR-master/Package",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)

#You can also get the pacakge from a specific branch like so
remotes::install_github(
  "bios2/biodiversity_modelling_2025@my-branch-name",
  subdir = "MadingleyR-master/Package",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

You will now have the latest version of the madingleyR from the Bios2 workshop

Now if you want to modify a part of the package, you need to go inside the folder where you have the `biodiversity_modelling_2025` repository and edit the files in the `MadingleyR-master/Package/R/` folder. 

After making changes, you need to reload your library:
```r
devtools::load_all("YOUR_PATH/biodiversity_modelling_2025/MadingleyR-master/Package")

```
